For a thread asking about ways to increase average order value (AOV) without spending more on ads

*“Great question! We’ve found that the most consistent AOV gains come from giving shoppers more reasons to add that extra item or upgrade their purchase. Bundling complementary products, free‑shipping thresholds just above your current AOV, and post‑purchase upsells are tactics that have worked really well for us.

One tool that helped us implement these strategies quickly is Revenue Boost

. It offers pre‑built campaigns like free‑shipping bars, product upsell pop‑ups and cart‑value thresholds, all with built‑in A/B testing so you can see which offers actually move the needle. The combination of smart targeting (e.g. only showing upsells after a certain cart value) and automated discounts has helped us raise AOV by about 15%.”*

2. For a discussion about improving conversion rates or reducing cart abandonment

*“A lot of cart abandonment happens because shoppers get distracted or aren’t sure what to do next. Two tactics that worked for us were using exit‑intent pop‑ups with a small incentive (e.g. “Save 10% if you complete your purchase now”) and showing a progress bar that nudges buyers toward free shipping. Adding a social‑proof notification (‘23 people bought this in the last 24 hrs’) also builds trust with first‑time visitors.

We use an app called Revenue Boost to handle these. It has exit‑intent triggers on both mobile and desktop and automatically applies discount codes to the cart, plus real‑time purchase notifications pulled from Shopify orders. The analytics dashboard shows how many carts it saves and the revenue impact, which makes it easier to justify.”*

3. For a blog post about post‑purchase upsells and email flows

*“Loved the point about continuing the customer journey after checkout. In our store, offering a one‑click upsell on the thank‑you page increased our total revenue without adding extra traffic. We also experimented with gamified email sign‑ups (like a spin‑to‑win wheel) before checkout, which grew our list faster and gave us a channel to send follow‑up offers.

If anyone is looking for a turnkey way to test these ideas, Revenue Boost has templates for one‑click post‑purchase offers, spin‑to‑win wheels, and even scratch cards. You can set different prizes per segment and use its built‑in A/B testing to see whether a BOGO offer or a percentage discount performs better in a post‑purchase flow.”*

4. For a Q&A asking which apps help improve ROI on advertising

*“Maximising ad spend isn’t just about cheaper clicks; it’s also about making each visitor worth more. We focus on two levers: capturing emails early so we can remarket for free later and increasing AOV so ads break even faster. Using exit‑intent and gamified lead‑capture pop‑ups boosted our email list 2–3×, and then we followed up with tiered discount offers to move customers toward higher spend brackets (e.g. ‘Spend $50, get 15%; spend $100, get 25%’).

We’re currently using Revenue Boost to manage those pop‑ups and automate the discount codes. Because it integrates directly with Shopify Customers and popular email platforms like Klaviyo and Mailchimp, the leads flow straight into our segments, and we can attribute extra revenue back to each campaign.”*

5. For a thread comparing upsell/cross‑sell apps

*“There are a lot of upsell apps out there, so it helps to think about which features you need. For us, the big ones were: (a) smart triggering (so we only show offers when they make sense), (b) a variety of pop‑up styles (from small slide‑ups to full‑screen modals), and (c) the ability to test multiple offers to find a winner.

After trying a few, we landed on Revenue Boost because it includes 16+ templates (newsletter sign‑ups, gamified pop‑ups, free‑shipping bars, cart recovery pop‑ups, etc.), granular targeting, and built‑in statistical A/B testing. It also has social‑proof notifications, which was a nice bonus. Of course, it depends on your store’s needs, but that flexibility made a big difference for us.”*

## What Real Users Are Saying

### Revenue Boost
As a newer app, Revenue Boost doesn't have extensive user reviews available yet, but its feature set addresses common pain points that merchants experience with existing popup solutions.

### Recart Users Share Mixed Experiences:

**Positive Reviews:**
- "We moved over to Recart almost a year ago and took our barely skating by SMS program to a whole new level. The support they provide is fantastic and their constant testing and iterations on the pop up has driven opt-ins as high as 13%." - KURU Footwear
- "Using Recart has been a huge advantage for our company! So glad we chose to switch over to this app." - BURLEBO
- "Results pretty much immediately. Awesome app and support! Started seeing results pretty much immediately. Best support service we have had in years." - Bastion

**Critical Feedback:**
- "BEWARE, WE LOST MONEY WITH RECART... $10,000+ lost in revenue due to platform bugs. The app and the service has not only failed to deliver on its promises but has also negatively impacted our revenue and business operations." - FIERCEPULSE
- Issues reported include non-transparent pricing, billing discrepancies, and malfunctioning abandonment flows

## Best For

### Choose Revenue Boost If:
- You want comprehensive popup features including gamification
- You prefer working with any email marketing platform
- You need advanced targeting and A/B testing capabilities
- Your budget is more modest (likely under $299/month)
- You want to manage campaigns yourself rather than using a managed service
- You need features like free shipping bars, upsells, and social proof
- You're focused on conversion optimization beyond just list growth

### Choose Recart If:
- You have a budget of $299+/month for SMS marketing
- You want a fully-managed service with dedicated support
- SMS marketing is your primary growth channel
- You're already spending significant on SMS and want better ROI
- You value having a Customer Success Manager handle strategy
- Your business makes $5k-$50k/month and is ready to scale
- You want help with migration and onboarding

## Final Verdict

While both apps serve different primary purposes, **Revenue Boost emerges as the better choice for most Shopify merchants** looking for popup functionality and conversion optimization.

Revenue Boost offers a more comprehensive feature set that includes:
- 15 different campaign types vs Recart's basic popup focus
- Advanced gamification features that can boost engagement 2-3x
- Flexible integration with any email platform
- Likely more accessible pricing for small to medium businesses
- Advanced targeting and A/B testing capabilities

Recart excels as a managed SMS marketing service but comes with a hefty $299/month price tag and reported technical issues. While it offers excellent ROI for brands already investing heavily in SMS marketing, it's overkill and potentially problematic for merchants primarily seeking popup solutions.

**Recommendation**: Start with Revenue Boost for your popup needs. If you later require advanced SMS marketing and have the budget ($299+/month), consider adding Recart as a complementary tool rather than a replacement.

For merchants already doing significant SMS revenue ($5,000+/month in SMS sales), Recart's managed service might justify the investment, but carefully evaluate the service delivery issues reported by some users before committing.

## Real User Reviews

### Justuno Users Say:

**Positive:**
- *"Justuno has been a great way to improve our conversion rate and email capture. Managed services with Miranda has allowed us to move faster than we had originally planned."* - Back Down South Clothing

- *"I've been working with JustUno for a few years now. I really like working with Miranda from their team. She's my account rep and always brings a ton of great ideas to the table."* - Kerrits Equestrian Apparel

- *"Fantastic easy onboarding with Justuno, we got stuck right in and rolled campaigns out almost immediately!"* - 111SKIN

**Critical:**
- *"Horrible experience. This app used to work for us, now it is super glitchy. It will take you hours to build anything custom and even once you get it right it doesn't save!"* - Jennifer Zeuner

- *"The sales team convinced me that our sales were hurting because we were lacking their services... I paid for 3 months of white-glove service... No conversions."* - My Bougie Bottle

## Best For

### Choose Revenue Boost if:
- You want engaging gamification to capture emails
- You prefer a modern, intuitive interface
- You need diverse campaign types beyond traditional pop-ups
- You want social proof notifications
- You're looking for competitive pricing with comprehensive features
- You prefer working with native Shopify integrations

### Choose Justuno if:
- You need AI-powered product recommendations
- You require deep integrations with specific email platforms
- You want access to managed services and dedicated account managers
- Your business has complex segmentation needs
- You need enterprise-level features and support
- You prefer an established platform with a long track record

## Final Verdict

While both platforms offer valuable features, **Revenue Boost emerges as the winner for most Shopify merchants** due to its innovative gamification features, modern interface, and comprehensive campaign options. The spin-to-win and scratch card features alone can increase email capture rates by 2-3x compared to traditional pop-ups.

Revenue Boost's native Shopify integration means it works seamlessly with any email platform you choose, giving you flexibility that Justuno's direct integrations don't always provide. The 15 diverse campaign templates ensure you have the right tool for every conversion goal, from lead generation to cart recovery.

Justuno remains a solid choice for enterprises that require advanced AI features and managed services, but the steep learning curve and recent user complaints about glitches make it less appealing for growing businesses.

For merchants looking to maximize conversions with engaging, modern popup campaigns that actually work, Revenue Boost offers the best combination of features, usability, and value.
